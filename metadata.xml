  <version>1.0.3</version>
  <releaseNotes>
    * 1.0.3 - nuget conveniently deletes files ending with .nuspec from the package even when you explicitly try to include them, so had to workaround that
    * 1.0.2 - content files weren't being included because nuget requires backslashes instead of forward slashes apparently
    * 1.0.1 - This is the first release
